Assembled by Matt Chapman (hubblefisher@gmail.com) through FOIA request.

Data includes: 
Sender 
To 
CC 
BCC 
Sent date/time 
Received date/time 

I use the dataset to determine 
a. communities / teams 
b. machine generated emails 
c. well-connected / trustworthy-people in this dataset

Thought process:

Identifying Machine generated emails: Heavy receiver and sender must be just a busy person but the combination of heavy sender and low receiver should be machine. Machines would show imbalance between sending and receiving behavior. Also Machines won't send to other machines most likely which may help out the categorization further.

Well-connected / Trustworthy people: Well-connected / trustworthy-people are those who have history of "receiving" any emails plus those who have multiple email exchange history with certain emails seemingly communicating with others instead of one-time, one-way communication.

Finding the Communities/ Teams in the dataset: To distinguish communities/teams, I used Frequent pattern mining. First I filter out all the machine generated emails from above analysis. Similar to Market basket analysis, I would take each email as a transaction and the email ids present in it as products. Then, I took a subset of emails having bulk email ids. Using FP growth algorithm, We could identify the set of email ids that appear in many emails by applying threshold for size of the set.
